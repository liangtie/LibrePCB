# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any LibrePCB product
(application, website, server, ...), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report any security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
Instead, use the private reporting mechanism of
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability):

**https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/security/advisories/new**

The report should contain as much information as possible to help us
understand and fix the vulnerability.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If you do not, please notify
us with an email to the address provided at https://librepcb.org/contact/
(ideally without sensitive information contained in the email).

If you don't have a GitHub account, you may send us the report directly to
the mentioned email address. But note that this way we cannot provide
encrypted communication.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer any communication to be either in English or in German.
